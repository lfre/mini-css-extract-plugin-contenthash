# mini-css-extract-plugin-contenthash

## **Update:**

This has been fixed in [#284](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/pull/284) and it's available in [v.0.4.4](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin/releases/tag/v0.4.4) ðŸŽ‰

**NOTE:** This same issue happens with javascript in webpack as of this writing (v.4.20.2), but can be solved by adding both `NamedChunksPlugin` and `HashedModuleIdsPlugin`.

Happy Building!
